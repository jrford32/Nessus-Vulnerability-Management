<h1>Nessus Essentials Vulnerability Managment</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
In this lab, I mplemented a comprehensive Vulnerability Management project where I orchestrated the installation and meticulous configuration of the Nessus Essentials scanner. This tool was downloaded from the Tenable Nessus website and the scans were conducted from a Windows 10 ISO file that was downloaded and ran on a VMware host client.

<br />


<h2>Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Tenable Nessus Essentials</b> 
- <b>VMWare</b>

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Windows 10 ISO</b>

<h2>Project Description</h2>

The client that was being scanned had an IP address of 192.168.28.128 (found using ‘ipconfig’ command), however when I attempted to run the ‘ping’ command I received a ‘Request timed out’ error. In order to fix this, I went to Windows Firewall settings on the virtual machine client and configured the firewall properties by switching the firewall state the ‘Off’ for the Domain, Private, and Public profiles:

Start > Settings > Search ‘Windows Defender Firewall’ > Domain Profile (Off) > Private Profile (Off) > Public Profile (Off) > OK

Uncredentialed Scan

In Nessus Essentials, I created a basic network scan titled “Windows 10 Single Host”  and copy & pasted the VM IP address into the ‘Targets’ section and launched the scan

<br />
The uncredentialed scan returned a result of zero vulnerabilities, therefore I decided to run another scan with authenticated/credentialed parameters.

Credentialed Scan
<br/>
<br/>
The steps I took to allow for authenticated permissions to be run on the Nessus software I obtained from the User Guide on the Tenable Nessus website. First, I enabled the remote registry on the VM client to allow for the scanner to check for insecure configurations.

<br />
Next, I went to the Registry Edit on Windows and created a new file titled ‘LocalAccount’TokenFilterPolicy’

<br />
I then went back into Nessus Essentials and updated my scan to include the credentials of the admin account of my Windows 10 host. Here are the results of the second scan:

As you can see, there was a substantial amount of vulnerabilities found in the second scan versus the first. The credentialed scan provided elevated access to the client system, allowing for a more in-depth scan of the system. The ‘Vulnerabilities’ tab lists out all the vulnerabilities that were found in the system and prioritizes each vulnerability from ‘Low’ to ‘Critical’. The ‘Remediations’ tab discusses each vulnerability in detail and gives suggestions on how to correct or remediate each finding.

<br />
Remediation

To show the process of remediating vulnerabilities, I installed a deprecated version of Mozilla Firefox and did a new scan on Nessus. Because I added a deprecated, unsupported software to the system, more ‘Critical’ and ‘High’ priority vulnerabilities were found

<br/>
<br/>
Based on the recommendations, these results could have been remediated by updating Windows OS as well as uninstalling Mozilla Firefox completely:

<h2>Summary</h2>
To summarize everything that was evaluated in this project, I installed Nessus Essentials and ran a remote scan on a Windows 10 client through a virtual machine. The target IP address was used to run both uncredentialed and credentialed scans to show the differences in the quantity of true vulnerabilities that are found. Because credentialed scans are provided more access to the target address, more vulnerabilities were found and those findings can be prioritized through remediation efforts. Installing the deprecated version of Mozilla Firefox allowed me to see the different strategies I was able to use to remediate the software and reduce the number of critical vulnerabilities.
