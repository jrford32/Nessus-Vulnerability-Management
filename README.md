<h1>Nessus Essentials Vulnerability Managment</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
In this lab, I mplemented a comprehensive Vulnerability Management project where I orchestrated the installation and meticulous configuration of the Nessus Essentials scanner. This tool was downloaded from the Tenable Nessus website and the scans were conducted from a Windows 10 ISO file that was downloaded and ran on a VMware host client.

<br />


<h2>Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Tenable Nessus</b> 
- <b>VMWare</b>

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Windows 10 ISO</b>

<h2>Program walk-through:</h2>

The client that was being scanned had an IP address of 192.168.28.128 (found using ‘ipconfig’ command), however when I attempted to run the ‘ping’ command I received a ‘Request timed out’ error. In order to fix this, I went to Windows Firewall settings on the virtual machine client and configured the firewall properties by switching the firewall state the ‘Off’ for the Domain, Private, and Public profiles:

Start > Settings > Search ‘Windows Defender Firewall’ > Domain Profile (Off) > Private Profile (Off) > Public Profile (Off) > OK

Uncredentialed Scan

In Nessus Essentials, I created a basic network scan titled “Windows 10 Single Host”  and copy & pasted the VM IP address into the ‘Targets’ section and launched the scan
